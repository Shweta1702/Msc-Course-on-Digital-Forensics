# Instructional Materials for the Digital Forensics Course
## Texas Tech University, Computer Science Department 

###### A course on "Digital Forensics" designed and offered in the Computer Science Department at Texas Tech University 2017 - 2018


This repository contains the instructional modules and course materials developed by [Dr. Akbar Namin](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/akbar_siami-namin/index.php), Associate Professor of [Computer Science](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/) at [Texas Tech University](http://www.ttu.edu/) to teach Digital Forensics. The materials were prepared, developed, taught during 2017 - 2018, and it is evolving. This course initiallay was developed as a graduate-level university course. But it can also be used for undergraduate students. The lecture notes were prepared by the insturctor of the course, the lab and hands-on experiences were developed by students taking the course.

## About the Course
Digital forensics has become a must-have skillset for IT professionals and in particular for security experts. Digital forensics and incident response play key roles in detecting and analyzing malware, security breaches, possible countermeasures, and tracing online criminal activities. Digital forensics, malware detection and analysis, and incident responses techniques are very wide and system-dependent. For instance, the techniques and tools used in detecting malware in Windows operating system are quite different than those used in Linux and Mac. Nevertheless, the security expert and more importantly ethical hackers need to be aware of the core and basic general topics and cocepts as well as platform-dependent techniques in order to be able to conduct penetration testing more effectively. 

This course introduces the basic concepts and techniques usually employed in digital forensics and malware analysis. The contents are primarily divided into the following major topics: 

1. Reverse Engineering
2. Disk Forensics
3. Memory Forensics
4. Network Forensics
5. Malware Analysis
6. Mobile Forensics

These four topics constitute the skeleton of security incidents and challenges. The security and forensics challenges usually exercised at the major hacking conferences such as DEFCON and Black Hat usually require in-depth knowledge of these four major topics when performed in different platforms. 

The course is completely practical supported with hands-on experiences and formal lectures. Students taking this course will be able to:
*	Demonstrate in-depth knowledge of cyber evidence and digital forensics
*	Perform disk, memory, and network digital forensics 
*	Demonstrate the knowledge of using forensics tools
*	Learn about the state-of-the-art in malware detection and analysis research 
*	Learn the basics of incident responses
*	Capture network, memory, and disk images for the purpose of forensics analysis
*	Practical malware analysis

The tentative topics and tools to be covered include:

*	Setting up a minilab for conducting experiment and analysis of digital forensics and malware execution and analysis
*	Reverse engineering through binary analysis tools such as RootKit, REMnux, sctest, and Libemu
*	Live collection and acquisition
*	Disk and media analysis: Disk structure, file systems (NTFS, HFS, etc.)
*	Disk and media forensics using tools such as Sleuthkit, Autopsy, foremost, scalpel, etc.
*	Memory forensics using techniques such as the volatility framework, WinDBG,  
*	Network forensics using techniques and tools such as WireShark, NetworkMiner, etc.
*	Kali Linux
*	Metasploitable Framework and tool
*	OWASP-BWA (Broken Web Application)
*	Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems forensics
*	Practicing digital forensics using real data
